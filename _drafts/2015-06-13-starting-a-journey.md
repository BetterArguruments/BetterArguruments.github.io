Like everything has to start somewhere, this journey began with a trip
[from Cologne to Heidelberg][route-k-hd]. Our goal was to get a prototype of an
app to maybe-it's-working-now-but-the-debugger-says-otherwise and into the
[Play Store][play-store]. All this under enormous time pressure of sixty-something
hours with little time to eat and unhealthily little sleep.
Plus we never built an app before.

[Ionic Framework]

In retrospect this were the most fun and educational times of writing code in my
history with programming languages. And we made something thats ours.

Now this journey continues and right here you are invited to trace our steps
and maybe even learn something.
